# PANS_Java_Game_Project
Multiplayer game written fully in Java Swing

The game isn't as I expected it to be.
In simplest words:

You shoot you move.
You hit pink or red polygon you take damage.
You pick white polygon you will get random buff.
Open store to change weapon or buff yourself.
Finish quests to get money.
